		<div class="main_content">
		    <p>Over the moon is the first restaurant that has been constructed on the moon. 
			The idea of building this restaurant came in our mind when NASA announced in 2015 that the Moon will be the second planet where surviving can be possible. 
			Then we thought, there should be a restaurant where people can enjoy a different kind of food that they never had on the Earth. 
			In our restaurant people can enjoy outdoor games like football on the moon, alien wrestling and swimming. 
			People can enjoy outing on the moon and our restaurant provide a free guide to the customers.  
            </p>
		</div>	
		<div class="main_content">

			<p>Come and visit our restaurant to enjoy a magnificient view of the earth. 
			We also provide accomodation to our guests at a very reasonable cost. 
			If you register for more than three people we provide you free accomodation as well as we come to your place to pick you up. 
			So don't miss the chance to visit our splended restaurant on the moon and enjoy the breath taking view of the earth from there.
